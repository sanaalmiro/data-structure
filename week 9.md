# Graph Traversal Applications (DFS & BFS)

### 🔍 Depth First Search (DFS)
**Concept:** Goes as deep as possible down one branch before backtracking.
- **Cycle Detection:** Used in compilers to check for circular dependencies.
- **Topological Sorting:** Used in task scheduling (e.g., figuring out which college courses to take first).
- **Maze Solving:** Exploring a single path until a wall is hit.

### 🌐 Breadth First Search (BFS)
**Concept:** Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
- **Shortest Path:** Finding the minimum number of edges between two nodes (e.g., GPS "Fastest Route").
- **Social Networks:** Finding "Friends of Friends" or degrees of separation.
- **Network Broadcasting:** Sending a packet from one router to all nearby routers.
